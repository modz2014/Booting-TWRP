Just a little script to be able to boot TWRP without installing it onto your device this will not TRIP KNOX
if you know what you are doing


Need to do 

Download ADB tools for windows or linux this will also work on Mac OSX
Twrp.img 

Make sure there is the same fold as running this script if your having problems let me know as i have only tested this script once

Debugging is enabled on the device

Also you need to find the blocks your wanting to dump you can edit the script and change it yourself 
how to find out the blocks you can install a system file browser called ES File Explorer File Manager
you dont need to be root to see the file system of your device only to edit the root file system which you dont need

# This can used to find exploits for android devices

# Booting-TWRP Dumping IMG files without root example bootloader
Booting TWRP without installing
